Sure, it's impressive that **bikes outnumber cars with a sweet 5:1 ratio**, which contributes to everything from overall health and air quality.\n",

    "Sadly, CityBikes decided not to include this city (I find it biased), perhaps due to the fact that if you live in Copenhagen, you probably own 3 to 6 bikes (on average). You guessed it right - running a bike rental company there would be a poor decision (unless you cater to tourists).\n",
